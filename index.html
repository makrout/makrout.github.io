               My research interests lie broadly in statistical signal processing, circuit theory for wireless communication, message passing optimization, and artificial intelligence for dermatology.

         My current work is focused on the following two projects:<br><br>		 
         <div class="accordion-wrapper">
            <div class="accordion">
               <input type="radio" name="radio-a" id="check1">
               <label class="accordion-label" for="check1">Scaling beyond 5G (B5G) communication systems</label>
               <div class="accordion-content">
                  <p>I study the scalability of future multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems in terms of the number of compact antennas and the operational bandwidth, with the purpose of reducing their cost/power and environmental footprints. Toward this goal, I analyse the performance of MIMO communication systems under physical constraints. The major difficulty of this analysis is that the performance criterion of interest (i.e., the achievable rate) emanates from communication theory while the physical constraints (i.e., antenna size and mutual coupling) arise from antenna theory. In other words, optimizing the achievable rate of MIMO systems while accounting for their physical size constraints is a problem that lies at the interface of communication and antenna theories. From this perspective, I am interested in combining Shannon and Maxwell theories using circuit-based physically consistent models which connect the physics of antennas with the mathematics of communication systems.</p>

                  <p>I co-founded <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aip.ai/">AIP Labs</a> in 2020, a digital health & AI company in Europe focused on dermatology. AIP is a high-tech & AI-enabled "digital hospital" platform focused on delivering a truly comprehensive healthcare offering. The urgent need for fully integrated and advanced end-to-end solutions has inspired us to encompass the entire patient and clinician journey, beginning to end. We leverage AI for more effective, more efficient, and more accessible dermatology care. At AIP, we have unparalleled access to quality medical data & feedback through our Semmelweis University 5-year partnership and the successful Hungary-wide pilot in early 2022 to millions citizens. This pilot was secured after successfully completing a rigorous 12-month evaluation by Semmelweis' medical departments. We now operate in Hungary, Slovakia and Spain, and are continuing to expand to other regions globally.</p>

         I have summarized in the "Resources" tab above some of my side projects and their useful artefacts (e.g., generative AI images, interview questions). Please feel free to contact me about any of the content there.
