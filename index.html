               My research interests lie broadly in optimization, statistical signal processing, artificial intelligence for dermatology and antenna theory for wireless communication.

         My current work is focused on the following two projects:
         <ul type=disc>
            <li> <strong>Scaling beyond 5G (B5G) communication systems</strong>: I study the scalability of future multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems in terms of the number of compact antennas and the operational bandwidth, with the purpose of reducing their cost/power and environmental footprints. Toward this goal, I analyse the performance of MIMO communication systems under physical constraints. The major difficulty of this analysis is that the performance criterion of interest (i.e., the achievable rate) emanates from communication theory while the physical constraints (i.e., antenna size and mutual coupling) arise from antenna theory. In other words, optimizing the achievable rate of MIMO systems while accounting for their physical size constraints is a problem that lies at the interface of communication and antenna theories. From this perspective, I am interested in combining Shannon and Maxwell theories using circuit-based physically consistent models which connect the physics of antennas with the mathematics of communication systems.

            <br>
            <li> <strong>Artificial intelligence for healthcare</strong>: I co-founded <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aip.ai/">AIP Labs</a> in 2020, a digital health & artificial intelligence (AI) company in Eastern Europe which has created the world's first end-to-end platform for dermatology and other medical verticals. We coin this platform "the digital hospital". It leverages AI for more accurate and comprehensive diagnoses at up to 10x faster, conveniently done remotely and asynchronously for both patients and clinicians. At AIP Labs, we have unparalleled access to quality medical data & feedback, through our Semmelweis University 5-Year partnership and the successful Hungary-wide pilot in early 2022 to over 5 million citizens. This pilot was secured after successfully completing a rigorous 12-month evaluation by Semmelweisâ€™ medical departments. Our goal is to maximize the full potential of AI and pair it with complementary software modules in revolutionizing medical care. This is a major step forward AI-driven medecine fulfilling its promise of improving triaging.</li>
